Within this document, you'll find some basic tips you should keep in mind that will help the installation and configuration of your new Slurp! install much nicer and easier.

First off, make sure you know what you're getting into. If words like "SQL", "PHP" and "variable" scare you, then this software may not be right for you. The rest of this document assumes you have a basic grasp of how servers work and so on.

Before installing, please make sure you know what kind of database system you'd like to use. Slurp! suports MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite. If your host provides more than one of these, then you should know which one you'd prefer to use. To help with this, below is an explanation of the differences between each database system.
- MySQL is one of the most popular RDBMS packages currently available, and is used by a few high-profile websites.
- PostgreSQL is fully open-source and is apparently alright.
- SQLite works somewhat differently from most other database systems, in that the database is stored in a single file on the webserver. If you feel that your server (and this service in particular) will be accessed by more than one or two users within a very small timeframe (a second or less), then you should use one of the other database systems, as SQLite does not like concurrent connections.
If this makes you scared, don't cry. Just pick MySQL, chances are that's fine.

Now that you've chosen a database system, you should make note of what kind of web server you're running, because web servers don't all handle redirection and URL rewriting the same way. If you're running lighttpd or Apache, then you're in luck, because a usable configuration is provided for both. If you run nginx or any other kind of web server, then chances are you know how to set up URL rewriting for 'em based on the lighttpd/apache configs provided. If you're running IIS then do not expect to get help from me, or from anyone else. Slurp! is not written for IIS, and I make a point to not fix any bugs that are specific to IIS/windows. You should know better. Unless you're forced to use that. Then I apologise, but I still won't help you.
The Apache config is provided as a standard .htaccess file, which you should only upload to your server if you actually use apache, otherwise it's a bit pointless. The lighttpd config needs to be added to the main lighttpd configuration file, or whatever lighttpd config file you have access to. The configuration itself is provided at the bottom of this document, and will need to be modified slightly to suit the domain (or subdomain) that Slurp! will be running on.

This document will become longer as development progresses, this is just initial documentation to make life easier later.
