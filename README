Slurp! v0.1a (Prerelease Alpha 1)
Slurp! is a URL shortener and file upload service. It is installable pretty much anywhere that wordpress is.
Slurp! uses PHPMailer to send emails.
Please ensure you've configured Slurp! via config.php.

You'll need:
A webserver supporting PHP 4.3 or newer (only tested in 5.0)
The PHP extension mysqli installed and usable
A MySQL server with the database set up accordingly (An install script is coming soon)
At least 100mb free on your web server. Slurp! itself only consumes 150~kb, but with file uploading being supported, extra space will be needed.
