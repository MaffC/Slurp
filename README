Slurp! v0.3a (Prerelease Alpha)
Slurp! is a URL shortener and file upload service. It is installable pretty much anywhere that wordpress is.
Slurp! uses PHPMailer to send emails.

Update (16 Nov '09): Slurp! now includes an upgrader, which suddenly became necessary after adding a new feature altered the tables and fields Slurp needed to operate.
Update (24 Oct '09): Slurp! now includes an installer to do initial configuration.

You'll need:
A webserver supporting PHP 4.3 or newer (only tested in 5.0)
The PHP extension mysqli installed and usable
A MySQL server with the database set up accordingly
At least 100mb free on your web server. Slurp! itself only consumes 150~kb, but with file uploading being supported, extra space will be needed.
An SMTP server (only if you want to enable registration approval)
