		<h1>Slurp! is a URL shortener and file upload system</h1>
		<p>Slurp! can take your data and your URLs, and give you a nice, clean URL like http://slrp.in/a0. If you upload a picture, Slurp! automatically detects this and will display the image instead of forcing the browser to download it. In the future, Slurp! may feature preview features (MP3 streaming and so on)</p>
